PROJECT REPORT (updated):


API USED : Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and Application Programming Interface used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. Three.js uses WebGL.

INSTRUCTIONS TO EXECUTE:
Please Have Internet connection as the Javascript for Three JS is a http Link .
Please view the Website In Full screen.
About the Assignment : (My learnings & build )

I have used Three JS and the three JS build in my assignment Construction .

I have Built a cube With 3D dimensions . Please move the mouse cursor to see the 3D cube .
I have also built a cone, Cylinder , Sphere in 3D.


I have tried to construct a Basic 3D tree which can be rendered using the modules of three JS.
The tree uses a Cone and Cylinder to render a Basic Model of a tree using primitive Geometry.

I have used Orbit controls which is embedded in the Build of Three JS to move the object around with the mouse to see the different perspective camera angles for my rendering .

I have Also constructed a Web page which can render objets like 
Cone
Cube 
Cylinder
Sphere 

With user input iterations to render a model n different times and have placed it at positions of XYZ + 100 from the initial position. I have used orbit controls to track the mouse movements.

I have rendered all the Images in the Website on a Canvas element.


Submission 2 :



A 3D Cube Rendered with User Co-ordinates with Dynamic HTML DOM Manipulation using Javascript and Three JS to Accomplish the Task.
A primitive Rendering of a Solar System with Spheres Placed in a orbit and with the Orbits Drawn Around the sphere representing a planet in our Solar System.
A 3D rendering of a solar system using MeshLambert Material in three Js and with the orbits rotating to form a constructive basic Solar system.
A Basic rendering of a cube , Cylinder and 2  Spheres.

Tabs In RED are First Submission , BLUE are Second Submission.

A 3D Cube Rendered with User Co-ordinates with Dynamic HTML DOM Manipulation using Javascript and Three JS to Accomplish the Task.


 Used the Cube Geometry function readily Available in the Three JS API to Render a Cube.
I have created Node Elements which are number Boxes to get user inputs for the width, length and height of the cube to rendered.
I had to learn how to inject HTML elements dynamically through W3 Schools.
The infected Elements are modeled and Styled using CSS to be placed at particular Positions.
The 3D rendering is done once the user Enters all the three fields. 
There are No checks placed to force the user to enter all Inputs.

A primitive Rendering of a Solar System with Spheres Placed in a orbit and with the Orbits Drawn Around the sphere representing a planet in our Solar System.

Used Primitive renderings of a sphere to pose as the planets in our solar system,
I have user particle geometry and Randomly spread the particles which are cubes to form Stars surrounding my Solar System.
I have manually set the Position of the orbits and Planets for a Better View of the Rendering .
I have created a Three Group to add All the Planets .
I used Mesh Basic material in this rendering which does not have any effects when lights are introduced using the API.

A 3D rendering of a solar system using MeshLambert Material in three Js and with the orbits rotating to form a constructive basic Solar system.
Used Primitive renderings of a sphere to pose as the planets in our solar system,
I have user particle geometry and Randomly spread the particles which are cubes to form Stars surrounding my Solar System.
I have manually set the Position of the orbits and Planets for a Better View of the Rendering .
I have created a Three Group to add All the Planets .
I used Mesh Basic material in the above rendering which does not have any effects when lights are introduced using the API.
So, I used Mesh Lambert Material which has lighting features on them in the second rendering.

Note: The Position of the planets are random and not based on any hard Math or Calculations. The Solar System represented in my submission placed the sphere In set positions to get a better view of the system rendering.


A Basic rendering of a cube , Cylinder and 2  Spheres. 
I have Made the 2 Spheres move around the cube and Cylinder.
This was the basic render which helped me create the solar System.

I have used the Official Three JS module from the Three JS website to download the Build and orbit control Files.

I have visited three JS website to find out about the materials and different types of Geometry's available to construct the Website.

I have Used CSS tricks.com to style my Web Page.
